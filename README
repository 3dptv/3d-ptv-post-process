This is post-processing software that reads the results of the 3D-PTV software in the format of ptv_is.NNNN files and reproduces several kind of results:

1. xuap.NNNNN files that include filtered x,y,z positions of the particles, velocities and accelerations (x,u,a of the particle) and trajectory identity of each particle. NNNN is the number of the frame were particle appeared

2. trajPoint.NNNNN files reorganize this data in the format that allows easier analysis of separate trajectories. There are more data also: temporal and spatial derivatives of velocity field. See /doc for more information


The directory contains different branches that were developed through years, mainly by Dr. Beat Luethi (ue = umlauth) affiliated with the ETH Zurich and Photrack AG, Zurich.

The license of post-process.cpp files is GPL v3. 
There are few files that has separate, MIT license, that were created by Jochen Willneff (ETH Zurich) and Alex Liberzon (Tel Aviv University).
